Library

This Library app is a simple web application designed to help users manage a collection of books. The application allows users to add books, display them in a visually appealing manner, update their read status, and remove them from the library. The project utilizes basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive user experience without the need for server-side processing.
